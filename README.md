# Earth-Sol Calendar (ESC)
Calendar based on the natural cycles of the Earth and Sun.

## Description

An open-source calendar based on maximum number factorisation (divisibility of 360 and 180, specifically), alignment with natural cycles (solstices) and structural proximity to current global standard (Gregorian) calendar (maximising ease of adoption).

The calendar features "a 6 day strong", rather than "a 7 day week". A regular structure 12 months per year, each of exactly 30 days. The strongs and months align (unlike the weeks and months of the Gregorian calendar).

Number factorisation determines synchronised cycles. For example, a 6 day "strong" has factors 2 and 3, and therefore can contain cycles of 2 or 3 days, in sync with the strong of 6 days. By contrast, a week of 7 days is a prime number, has no factors, and therefore has no sub-cycles that can run in synchronisation with a weekly cycle.

Days of the strong are colour-coded (from red to purple), rather than named. The names of the colours in any local/native language can be used to refer to the days. The order of the colours is based on the natural physics of the electromagnetic spectrum and dispersion of white light (e.g., in a rainbow).

### Calendar Structure:

* 360 *calendrical* days per year (and 5 or 6 *intercalary days* per year)
    * Two hemispheres (halfs) of 180 days twice a year
    * 5 intercalary days per non-leap year, aligned with solstices (2 days and 3 days for winter and summer solstice respectively (northern hemisphere))
    * 6 intercalary days each leap year (3 days and 3 days on solstices)
* 12 months per year (6 months in each hemisphere)
    * 30 days per month
        * 5 strongs per month
            * 6 days per strong
