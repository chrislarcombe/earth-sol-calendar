# Earth-Sol Calendar (ESC)
Regular harmonic calendar based on the natural cycles of the Earth and Sun, and number factorisation.

See a [live demo](https://larcombe.io/esc) of the calendar.

## Description

A public domain open-source calendar based on number factorisation (the divisibility of 360 and 180, specifically, which have the highest number of divisors/factors), alignment with natural cycles (solstices) and structural proximity to current global standard (Gregorian) calendar (maximising ease of adoption).

The calendar features "a 6 day strong", rather than "a 7 day week". A regular structure 12 months per year of exactly 30 days each. The days and strongs therefore align with the months (unlike the months of the Gregorian calendar, which are irregular and therefore do not align with the days and weeks).

Number factorisation determines possible synchronised cycles. For example, a 6 day "strong" has factors 2 and 3, and therefore can contain cycles of 2 or 3 days, in synchronisation with the strong of 6 days. By contrast, a week of 7 days is a prime number, has no factors, and therefore has no possible sub-cycles that can run in synchronisation with a weekly cycle. In the ESC it is therefore possible for an activity to take place every 2 or 3 days and for these days to be the same days each strong, while also synchronising with the month.

Days of the strong are colour-coded from red to purple, rather than named. The numbers 1 to 6 can also be used, e.g., "Day 1". The names of the colours in any local/native language can be used to refer to the days. The order of the colours is based on the globally culturally-independent natural physics of the  electromagnetic spectrum and dispersion of white light (e.g., in a rainbow).

In the ESC there are also 6 'intercalary' days, which fall outside of the regular count of the strongs and months: the leap day, a New Year's day, and 4 'transcalary' days which fall outside of the count of the year (whereas the leap day and New Year's day occur within the context of a year). The 4 transcalary days occur as 2 consecutive days on each solstice, marking the solstices, which are natural start and end points. The transcalary days are explicitly outside of the count of the year, representing the idea of non-linear time, 'non-time', 'eternity', or 'now-time'.

The year count (New Year's Day, year 1) begins on what was known as '21st December 2012' (Winter Solstice '2012' in the Northern Hemisphere) in the Gregorian Calendar. At the time of writing it is currently year 8. New Year's day was chosen to be around the same time of the year as in the Gregorian calendar for global cultural continuity, though now adjusted to align with the cycle of the natural (actual) year.

The strongs can also be numbered or named: one suggestion is to use the natural elements in the following order: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Spirit. The existence of the 5th element is evident and known to growing portion of the global human population. The names of the elements can also be easily translated into all languages, since the 5 elements are present and known in most if not all human cultures on Earth.

### Calendar Structure:

* 360 *calendrical* days per year and 6 *intercalary days* per year
    * Two hemispheres (halfs) of 180 days twice a year
    * 5 intercalary (4 transcalary) days per non-leap year, aligned with solstices
        * 2 days (2 transcalary) and 3 days (2 transcalary + 1 New Year's day) for winter* and summer* solstice 
    * 6 intercalary (4 transcalary) days each leap year, aligned with solstices
        * 3 days (2 transcalary + 1 leap day) and 3 days (2 transcalary + 1 New Year's day) for winter* and summer* solstice
* 12 months per year (6 months in each hemisphere)
    * 30 days per month
        * 5 strongs per month
            * 6 days per strong

*(relative to Northern Hemisphere, which is home to approximately 70% of humanity)
